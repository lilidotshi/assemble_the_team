ASSEMBLE! is an app that seeks to create spontaneous gatherings. By adding friends to the app, you can seen "ASSEMBLE!" calls to all of your closest friends
with the touch of a single button. They will receive a message, along with coordinates of where you are currently located. Cool street event? ASSEMBLE!
Sudden concert in the park? ASSEMBLE! Want to just hang out at your apartment? ASSEMBLE! The idea behind ASSEMBLE! is to connect with friends as easily
and as often as possible.

Still in development.

Tasks to do.

Alpha version:
Create an SMS with all added contacts, and send with coordinates and a simple message. Coordinates can be clicked (should open up Google Maps in
Android devices).

Beta version: 
Set up a server and start populating with users, indexed by their phone number and their user name. That way all requests can be done via the
app.
Create a small thumbnail of Google Maps in the app itself.
Allow users to respond to ASSEMBLE! calls with a "Will Be There!" or "Will Not Be There!".
Log all ASSEMBLE! calls and respond tos, for historic and memory purposes (will be stored as data).

Beyond beta:
Allow ASSEMBLE! calls to be categorized by type or "surprise me".
Start tracking what users respond to the most based on type (e.g. more users respond to "food" requests rather than "wrestling rabid badgers" requests.)
Start suggesting event nearby (based on internet searches, user location, and user preferences).
